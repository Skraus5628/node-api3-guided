# Node API 3 Guided Project

Guided project for **Node API 3** module.

In this project we will learn how to create a very simple Web API using `Node.js` and `Express`, and learn to use and create `Express Middleware`.

## Prerequisites

- a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download/) or [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/) installed.

## Project Setup

- [ ] fork and clone this repository.
- [ ] **CD into the folder** where you cloned the **your fork**.
- [ ] type `npm install` to download dependencies.

Please follow along as the instructor creates and adds `middleware` to the API step by step.


<!-- 4 types of middleware
1. Built-in middleware (comes with express)
2. third-party middleware (has to be installed with NPM)
3. Custom middleware (we write it ourselves)
4. Error middleware (catch errors in other middleware functions) -->

<!-- installed morgan middleware --IP logger! its cool! -->
<!-- installed Helmet middleware, secures express apps with headers! -->

<!-- middleware runs in the order it's defined in -->
